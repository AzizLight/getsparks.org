# The GetSparks.org CodeIgniter Respository

This project is the repository at
[getsparks.org](http://getsparks.lighthouseapp.com/projects/70187-getsparksorg-repository/overview)
that will likely act as the central location for holding user-contributed CodeIgniter
information.

## Why Package Management For CodeIgniter?

There's been a lot of positive feedback surrounding this project, but here are the
core reasons that this would be extensively valuable:

1. The community will be able to more actively contribute to CodeIgniter. Write
   a great library, and contribute it as a 'spark' for everyone to use.
2. It's a central place for easy-to-install CodeIgntiter libraries. No more googling,
   scraping blogs, wikis, and other websites for functionality that *might not even work*.
3. The Reactor Core won't have to take on superfluous new libraries. Reactor will
   stay a light, ultra-fast framework, will developers are free to add on to it
   via sparks.
4. GetSparks.org will have a rating and comment system. The best libraries will
   rise to the top, and become featured on the site.

## The Management System

The Spark management system is being developed under a second project, at
[https://github.com/seejohnrun/sparks](https://github.com/seejohnrun/sparks). That is the actual CLI package manager
which one day _might_ be integrated into Reactor (projected for Q2 or Q3).

## Project Info & Management

This project is currently managed via the publicly-visible
[getsparks lighthouse account](http://getsparks.lighthouseapp.com/projects/70187-getsparksorg-repository/overview).

## Getting Set Up Locally

This is a standard CodeIgniter App.

1. Clone the repository into a webroot of yours
2. Set up your database (latest schema is in sql/)
3. Edit your database.php and config.php configurations
