<h2>Step 3. Making Sparks</h2>

<p>
    Contributing code and being recognized for awesome and useful code: It's what we love about
    being open-source developers. Learn how to make and distribute your own sparks.
</p>

<h3>How Contributing Works</h3>

<p>
    GetSparks.org is <strong>entirely backed by external repositories.</strong>
    That means we do not host your projects. Your project can live happily on your
    <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://bitbucket.com" target="_blank">BitBucket</a> account, or personal git or mercurial server. When you
    register a spark at GetSparks, you simply point us to your repository.
</p>

<p>
    That's awesome for a few different reasons:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>All your cool open-source projects can remain in one place.</li>
    <li>
        You'll get the fun of wikis, issue trackers, and watchers automatically
        if you use GitHub or BitBucket.
    </li>
    <li>
        You aren't forced to use some antiquated versioning system in order to contribute. GetSparks
        can easily support new VCSs over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        We don't have to worry about bandwidth issues.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    After that, you register new versions of your spark on GetSparks by pointing
    us towards an identically named tag in your repository. That is, if you
    create tag '1.0' in your repo, just add a '1.0' version to your project in
    GetSparks. In a few minutes, it'll be available to the world.
